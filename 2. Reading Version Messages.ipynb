    "* I renamed `Message` to `Packet` because we're going to start defining things like `VersionMessage` and `VerackMessage` and so this seemed a little more clear.\n",
    "* `Packet` instances look like pretty tables when printed. This is because I added a `Network.__str__` method to [ibd/one/complete.py](./ibd/one/complete.py). `object.__str__` is the function Python calls when determining _how_ to print a given `object`. This `Packet.__str__` method simply runs a few of its values through this [tabulate](https://bitbucket.org/astanin/python-tabulate) program, which I added to our requirements.txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Payload\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next task is to parse this payload. Besides the \"/Satoshi:0.16.0/\" -- clearly a user agent -- the rest of the payload isn't human readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "But have no fear -- we will decode the message payload in the same manner as we decoded the overall message structure in our `Packet.from_socket` method from last class.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "![image](./images/version-message.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Old Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we encounter some \"types\" we are now familiar with from the first lesson -- `int32_t` / `uint64_t` / `int64_t` -- which are different types in a \"low-level\" language like C++, but are all equivalent to the `int` type in Python. Our previously implemented `bytes_to_int` can handle these just fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### New Types\n",
    "\n",
    "But we also encounter some new types: `net_addr`, `varstr`, and `bool`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even worse, if we click on the [`varstr` link](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#Variable_length_string) we see that it contains one additional type: `varint`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Worse still, the [`net_addr` link](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#Network_address) contains `time`, `services` and `IPv6/4` fields nominally of types `uint32`, `uint64_t` and `char[16]` but in order for us to make sense of what they hell them mean each requires parsing: the `time` integer as a Unix timestamp, the `services` integer as a damn \"bitfield\" (whatever that is!), and `IPv6/4` IP address as a 16 digit bytestring where the first 12 digits are always `00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 FF FF` and only the last 4 matter! \n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, and remember how I mentioned that Satoshi usually, but not always, encoded his integers in \"little endian\" byte order (least significant digits is on the left)? Well, the `port` attribute of `net_addr` is encoded \"big endian\", where the *most* significant digit is on the left. Yes, the exact opposite of everything else!!!\n",

    "# VersionMessage\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the outline of a `VersionMessage` class which will abstract the `version` [message type](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#version):\n",
    "\n",
    "* It has an `__init__` constructor method, which allows us to pass a different set of `version`, `services`, `timestamp`, `addr_recv`, `addr_from`, `nonce`, `user_agent`, `start_height`, and `relay` values to each new instance.\n",
    "* It will have a hard-coded [\"class variable\"](https://www.toptal.com/python/python-class-attributes-an-overly-thorough-guide) of `command = b\"version\"`. With this decision we are setting a convention: any instance of this class or the other 26 `Message` classes we still have to implement will have a `msg.command` attribute  to tell us what kind of message we're dealing with.\n",
    "* `VersionMessage.from_bytes` is also a convention that all 26 other `Message` classes will implement. Let's assume we are trying to handle an incoming `Packet` instance, which we will call `pkt`. We observe that `pkt.command` is `b\"version`, so we're dealing with a version message and need to turn `pkt.payload` into an instance of the `VersionMessage` class defined in the cell above. The purpose of this `VersionMessage.from_bytes` classmethod is facilitate this: `msg = VersionMessage.from_bytes(pkt.payload)`. It's magic!\n",
    "* We will do some operations many times -- such as reading `n` bytes and interpreting them as a Python `int` -- so it makes sense to implement so-called \"helper methods\" to simplify our code, make it more testable and readable. `read_int`, `read_var_str`, `read_var_int` and `read_bool` are some such methods waiting to be implemented."

This technique strives to use only the space it needs. It does so by prepending a \"variable length integer\" in front of the string value being communicated, which tells the receiver how many bytes they should read in order to read the encoded string value. This is kind of similar to how the payload bytes are handled in our `Packet.from_socket` -- first we read `length` and then we read `length`-many bytes to get our raw payload. Same idea here, but now the length of the string isn't an integer, but a \"variable length integer\".\n",

    "How does this `var_int` work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first byte of a `var_int` is a marker which says how many bytes come after it:\n",
    "* `0xFF`: 8 byte integer follows\n",
    "* `0xFE`: 4 byte integer follows\n",
    "* `0xFD`: 2 byte integer follows\n",
    "* < `0xFD`: 0 bytes follow. Interpret first byte as a 1 byte integer.\n",

    "\n",
    "[The version section of the protocol docs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#version) provides us with the following guide for interpreting the `services` field of the `version` payload:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](images/services.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of this field is \"bitfield\". [Check out the wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field) for a more detailed explanation that I can provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bitfield is an integer. Every bit of the base-2 representation (e.g. \"101\" is base-2 representation of 5) holds some pre-defined meaning. This particular bitfield is 8 bytes / 64 bits (remember, a byte is just a collection of 8 bits so 8 bytes is 8*8=64 bits).\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table above we can see that the least significant digit in the binary representation (decimal value `2^0=1`) represents `NODE_NETWORK`, or whether this peer \"can be asked for full blocks or just headers\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The second least-significant digit (decimal value `2^1=2`): `NODE_GETUTXO`\n",
    "\n",
    "The third least-significant digit (decimal value `2^2=4`): `NODE_BLOOM`\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth least-significant digit (decimal value `2^3=8`): `NODE_WITNESS`\n",
    "\n",
    "The eleventh least-significant digit (decimal value `2^10=1024`): `NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED`\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the bits (decimal values `2*n` where n in {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, ..., 63} have no meaning, yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in order to interpret this field we need to look up the nth bit in the table above and see if it means anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our Python code could produce a dictionary like this for every node we connect to. This would allow us to look up what services that node offers _by name_ (which is why it's called a dictionary!):\n",

    "}\n",
