    "\n",
    "![image](./images/message-structure.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole goal of these three attributes is to read the payload -- which could be a newly mined block, or a transaction, or the address of a newly connected bitcoin full node -- and verify that the payload wasn't corrupted at all in transmission over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Payloads vary in length. A [`verack` message](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#verack) has empty payload. A [`block` message](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#block) payload may contain thousands of transactions, each with tens of inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with the varying lengths of message payloads, the Bitcoin protocol messages always include a `length` parameter which tells us exactly how many bytes to read. This helps us avoid only reading part of the payload and stopping, or overshooting and reading into the next message (like the example above where I read two messages by accident).\n",
    "\n",
    "And once we read the payload, how can we be sure that what we receive is the same as what our peer node sent us?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, TCP ensures against packet loss using checksums and the Bitcoin network protocol is just a thin layer on top of TCP. [But apparently its checksumming mechanism (which I don't understand) may be less effective than `sha256`](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/22882/what-is-the-function-of-the-payload-checksum-field-in-the-bitcoin-protocol). In any case, Satoshi implemented a further [\"checksum\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum) to guarantee data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checksums are a simple idea: You take the message and run it through a [hashing algorithm](https://blog.jscrambler.com/hashing-algorithms/) -- in this case you run it through `sha256` twice -- and take just a few bytes of the result -- in this case the first 4. Given an input `x`, a hashing algorithm `h` will always produce the same output `h(x)`. Since the output is the same, the first four digits of the output will always be the same. And since the key property of hashing functions is going from `h(x) -> x` requires brute forcing, you'd need to try about 256^4 ≈ 500,000,000 values (a byte contains 256 possible values and there are 4 bytes) on average to fake any given payload without modifying the checksum. So I guess Satoshi thought that would help!"
